## Description
This workshop will allow a small group of researchers and industry representatives the opportunity to focus on and exchange ideas about this emerging market and its unique opportunities and challenges. We are also preparing a review article that we hope to refine with workshop participants’ input.  

The workshop immediately follows the IEA PVPS Task 13 meeting in the same location during the first part of the week.

Our colleagues at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE) have graciously offered to organize the logistical aspects of the workshop, and participants will be asked to pay a nominal fee to cover these costs in addition to their transportation and lodging expenses.
